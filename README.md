# LLM Chatbot with Neo4j
This project demonstrates how to build a chatbot using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Neo4j, a graph database. The chatbot is designed to answer questions about Pokemon, leveraging the power of Neo4j for efficient data storage and retrieval.

### Pokémon Chatbot App

Click [here](https://pokemon-chatbot.streamlit.app/) to access the Pokémon Chatbot deployed on Streamlit.

## Features
- LLM Integration: The chatbot utilizes LLMs, such as GPT-3, to generate natural language responses to user queries.
- Neo4j Graph Database: Pokemon data is stored in a Neo4j graph database, allowing for efficient querying and retrieval of related information.
- Vector Search: The chatbot uses vector embeddings to perform semantic search on the Pokemon data, enabling more accurate and relevant responses.
- Cypher Query Generation: The chatbot can generate Cypher queries based on user questions, allowing it to retrieve specific information from the Neo4j database.
- Streamlit Interface: A user-friendly interface is provided using the Streamlit library, making it easy to interact with the chatbot.

## Acknowledgments
- Langchain for providing a powerful framework for building LLM applications.
- Neo4j for their excellent graph database solution.
- Sentence Transformers for enabling vector embeddings.
